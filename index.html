								<p>Hi folks, this paragraph is going to be about my basic stuff. If you want to flee from it, then skip to the next para. I am an Indian citizen with Chennai, Tamil Nadu, as my home town. I have done my 12th grade at Chennai Public School, having Computer Science as my background. Telugu being my mother tongue, I am also well-versed in speaking and writing in Tamil and English. Just like a typical engineering aspirant, I dreamt of joining IIT's and NIT's, which eventually ended up being appended to my stack of failures. However, my passion for learning computer science made me pursue my bachelor's in "Information Technology" at SSN College of Engineering.¬† I was 2021 passed out student. I am currently working as a software development engineer at PayPal.</p>
								<p>After computers, the next thing that captivates me a lot would be movies and cinema. I am a big fan of "Ajith Kumar", an actor popularly known as "Thala" in the Kollywood industry. The above statement reflects my nature as a movie buff. If I had to describe myself in terms of nature, I would say that Navein Kumar is a person who opts to be in a small but very healthy and truthful friendship circle. Also, he has a strong gravitational pull towards humour.¬† </p>
								<p>On the technical side, I was always excited when I heard the fancy term "Machine Learning" from the voice of Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, in his interviews and seminars on Google's I/O. On the other hand, when I came to know about the outcomes and viability of this so-called domain "Machine Learning", I was totally astonished. How can a machine automate everything that a human can do while also outperforming its creators? This acted as the driving factor to get my hands dirty on this domain. I define machine learning as "the way or method that the programmer chooses to teach the machines." The more creative the method, the more accurate the machines. I started my dream of being a machine learning engineer when I was given a chance to work as a data science intern at Nokia PVT LTD. This platform gave me enough exposure to get familiar with the domain and work on various industrial projects assigned to me. After graduating from college, PayPal created a space for me to explore some of their business projects, which required me to master various essential skills as a software developer. This experience taught me to seek out opportunities to broaden my knowledge of computer science. My love for computers and learning to master them is a never-ending story....</p>
